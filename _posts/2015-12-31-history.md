When the city's first redesign happened, it was almost three years in the making. For the 2015 refresh of the site, management and City Council had a much bigger expectation.

When the idea was put forward in September 2014, the plan was to move the city's site to a new content management system by October 2015, then deliver a new design in 2016. Council, instead, said they wanted both in 2015.

Without additional staff, I fell back on what resources were already available:

1. Strict enforcement of content/design separation in the content management system.
2. Customer form with high traffic from site users.
3. CSS that had been well tested in older versions of Internet Explorer.

I started with research using the forms. By requiring form respondents to categorize their request according to sample taxonomies, I was able to prove what topic areas resonated with users. Unsurprisingly, users were more likely to categorize their requests correctly when the categories weren't based on the city's department hierarchy.

The 12 categories used in the test were chosen as homepage navigation, and a flat design aesthetic was chosen to keep graphic needs to a minimum.

From there, the Graphics Division created color schemes and icons, and I fast tracked the options through city management directly instead of forming a committee. The graphic creation and approvals still ate four months.

This is where leveraging modern technology and web trends simplified the work.

I gave myself only one month to code and implement the design, and limited any redesigning to the template level only. Page content had to work in its existing form with only minor modifications.

Rather than getting mired in bug fixes for a new layout, conditional comments were used to serve a modified version of the old templates (with a new header and footer) to older versions of Internet Explorer. This left the new stylesheets to focus solely on modern browsers.

Using Flexbox and CSS media queries for layout, and using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to ensure crisp images on all screens, the actual coding of the new design only took a week of work. PostCSS' Autoprefixer plugin was used both to save time and future proof the site by eliminating the need for me to look up all the vendor-prefixed versions of the code I used, and instead allowed me to write standards-compliant code.

From there, the design work was largely done, allowing the real heavy lifting to begin on the content management system. But that will take an article of its own.
