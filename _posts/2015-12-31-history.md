When the city's first redesign happened, it was almost three years in the making. For the 2015 refresh of the site, management and City Council had a much bigger expectation.

When the idea was put forward in September 2014, the plan was to move the city's site to a new content management system by October 2015, then deliver a new design in 2016. Council, instead, said they wanted both by October.

Without additional staff, I fell back on what resources were already available:

1. Strict enforcement of content/design separation in the content management system meant content would be easy to  move over.
2. We had comment forms where people where people were already submitting information about their needs.
3. I already had a responsive design that was backward compatible with old versions of Internet Explorer.

I started with research using the forms. By requiring form respondents to categorize their request according to sample taxonomies, I was able to prove what topic areas resonated with users, and it wasn't based on the city's department hierarchy. Twelve categories were chosen as homepage navigation, and a flat design aesthetic was chosen to keep graphic needs to a minimum.

From there, the graphics department created color schemes and icons, and I fast tracked the options through city management instead of committee. Altogether, four months were down, and the content management system needed more attention.

This is where leveraging modern technology and web trends simplified the work.

I gave myself only one month to code and implement the design and limited any redesigning to the template level only. Thanks to conditional comments, media queries and other tools in browsers, a tweaked version of the existing template could serve all content from the new site on older browsers. This allowed the new code to be free of legacy layouts.

Using Flexbox and scalable graphics (SVG), then using automated tools to ensure backward compatibility, the actual coding of the new design only took a week of work. The remaining time was spent trying to create as much consistency as possible between the new and legacy templates.

From there, the design work was largely done, allowing the real heavy lifting to begin on the content management system.
