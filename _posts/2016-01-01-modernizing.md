When I started working on the City of Fort Worth website in 2006, it was in the final stages of its first redesign.

The project, which required training of more than 200 staff members and at least three outside contractors, moved thousands of pages into a table-based layout powered by an enterprise content management system.

Most of the 200 staff members trained could alter the site's taxonomy by changing menus in the content management system, few had made significant changes to their content before simply moving it to the new system, and they had no training on how what they did in the editor could impact accessibility of the site.

With the poor performance of more than 20 javascript-powered menus on the site and table layouts hampering accessibility, the city's webmaster left and most of the 200 staff members trained were in constant need of retraining and refreshers.

I temporarily stepped into the webmaster position and familiarized myself with the system. I began teaching myself HTML/CSS to see how to improve the site and, when a permanent webmaster was brought on board three months later, we started formulating plans to overhaul the site without need of a large team.

I created a new (X)HTML template based on the original design and spent 2008 and 2009 moving all the templates into the new format and refreshing the content to remove old layouts that were migrated into the content management system. More than half of the pages in the system were ultimately identified as redundant or unneeded and were scrapped.

Performance increased immediately, with many pages (including the homepage) dropping from thousands of lines of HTML to just a couple hundred.

Our two-person web team had taken on responsibility for more than 90 percent of the updates made to the site since most trained content management system users didn't keep up their skills.

Then the bottom fell out of the effort.

Our two person "team" was cut to just me due to budget constraints, and I also was saddled with handling email marketing, all news releases and internal communications and even became a city photographer.

In spite of this, I took this an opportunity to modernize the site further.

The news releases were changed into website posts, which were linked in a new email newsletter. I created improved navigation, but used the increase in photography available to better highlight news.

Then, in 2013, while sitting at a communications conference in a presentation about the importance of mobile, I decided to take what I knew about responsive layouts and apply it to the city site. I did a slight graphic refresh and made the site mobile responsive (a design still available on the [Fort Worth Library website](http://fortworthtexas.gov/library/)).

Though only representing a few days of work, the responsive retrofit took two months to implement due to the weight of other tasks.

Luckily, 2014 brought new staff to the city, freeing me to take on a much bigger task: A full redesign and implementing a new content management system.
