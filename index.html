    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>This portfolio site was designed in two hours as an experiment with flexbox layouts and SVG. Learn more about the techniques I use in the <strong>Portfolio</strong> section.</p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I have managed web content for the 16<sup>th</sup> largest city in the United States, Fort Worth, Texas,  since 2006, and have updated the front-end code to evolve with changing web practices.</p>
    <p>I changed the site from a table-based layout to a CSS layout in 2008, and moved the city to a responsive version of the site in 2013.</p>
    <p>While working as a one-person web shop responsible for more than 90 percent of website updates, I completed a full redesign from the ground up in 2015. The new design includes a flexbox layout and an SVG sprite for icons and core graphics. The site also utilizes the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS CSS pre-processor</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">PostCSS Autoprefixer plugin</a> to ensure backward compatibility. All pages managed in my office are <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">built using Jekyll</a>, a static-site generator, and are version-controlled with <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
