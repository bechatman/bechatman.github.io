<h2>Web Experience at City of Fort Worth</h2>
<h3>Copy Writer/Content Management System Trainer, June-December 2006</h3>
<p>I started my career with the City of Fort Worth writing news stories about activities in various departments, and training subject matter experts to maintain their own web content.</p>
<h3>Interm Webmaster/Assistant Web Managing Editor, December 2006-September 2010</h3>
<p>During this time, I took my extensive knowledge of how to use web software and pulled back the curtain to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. I went from making edits with a mouse to coding entire web pages with a keyboard, even rebuilding the City of Fort Worth website templates to conform with modern web standards.</p>
<h3>Web/Communications Specialist, September 2010-May 2013</h3>
<p>Due to budget cuts, I filled several roles. I continued to maintain the website, but I also took on sole responsibility for news releases, email marketing and internal communication. During this time, I also completed a full responsive/adaptive design retrofit of FortWorthTexas.gov.</p>
<h3>Web Content Strategist, May 2013-present</h3>
<p>I was promoted to a supervisory position with a copy writer as a direct report. I trained her in HTML/CSS, Github version control and how to use our content management system. Also during this time, I single-handedly migrated our web content to a new content management system and redesigned the site.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I have a strong background in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and content strategy/copy writing. I am proficient in <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, I have worked with several website content management systems, and I have experience with Javascript, jQuery, JSON/XML APIs.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I hope to find a job where I can continue to grow my web skill set as new technologies and tools emerge, while bringing my experience in a large, multi-faceted organization to bear on new challenges.</p>
